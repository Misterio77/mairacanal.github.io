<div class="w-100">
	<p>I’m a Computer Engineering BSc student at the São Carlos School of Engineering (EESC-USP). During my time at the university, I served as an Embedded Systems Monitor, and I'm currently developing a research paper to analyze the application of Embedded Linux in soft real-time applications.</p>

	<p>Since my freshman year, I'm part of an extracurricular group, <a href="https://zenith.eesc.usp.br" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <b>Zenith Aerospace</b></a>, a group that develops nanosatellites and space probes. I coordinated the Embedded Systems Department for about a year, in which I developed my communication and sense of leadership. In the group, I also addressed many problems integrating Hardware and Software during the use of Yocto and D-Bus.</p>

	<p>Since October 2020, I'm an independent Linux Kernel Contributor with more than ten approved patches in the regulator, SPI, media, mfd, and DRM subsystems.</p>
